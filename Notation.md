## Lazer Algebraic Notation (for Lazer Chess)

Algebraic notation (or AN) is the standard method for recording and describing the moves in a game of [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess). Built upon that idea, this a notation modified for the game of [Lazer Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Chess), and we are calling it **Lazer Algebraic Notation** (or **LAN**)

Just as the Chess Algebraic Notation, **LAN** is based on a system of [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinates) to uniquely identify each square on the board.



#### **Naming the squares**

[todo]



#### Naming the piece

Each piece, is identified by an uppercase letter.
The identification is the first letter of the piece name, except for the **Deflector** which is **B** (because D for Deflector would be confused with the one of the Defender. *The letter B came from Bend*).

| Name      | Identification |
| --------- | -------------- |
| King      | K              |
| Switch    | S              |
| Defender  | D              |
| Deflector | B              |
| Lazer     | L              |



#### Colors

One color per player:

1. Blue / White
2. Red / Gray



#### Notation for moves

Each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinate of the destination square.

For example, **Ke5** (move a bishop to e5), **Nf3** (move a knight to f3). For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, **c5** (move a pawn to c5).
